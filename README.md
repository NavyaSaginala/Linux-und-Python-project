Project Title: Scatter plot to show the responses of the Nectar volume to the Corolla length

Overview:

The goal of this study is to determine if there is a correlation between the size of a flower's corolla and the amount of nectar it produces for hummingbirds. In order to account for the fact that data from different plant species are not truly independent. We used a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) regression model in our analysis.

Files:

Data compilation of hummingbird-pollinated plant species.xlsx: Excel file containing the data used in the analysis.

hummingbird-pollinated-plant-species.py: Python script used to analyze the data and generate the PGLS regression plot.

pgls_regression_plot.png: PNG file of the PGLS regression plot.

Dependencies:

This project requires the following Python packages:

pandas 

matplotlib

statsmodels

Usage:

In order to generate the results of the study and produce the PGLS regression plot, you will need to execute the Hummingbird-pollinated-plant-species.py script within a python environment that has the necessary dependencies installed.
